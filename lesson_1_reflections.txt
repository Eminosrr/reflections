How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It enables me to identify the source of the error in revised code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you more efficinet programmer in the long term?
Access to the entire history of code provides you valuable information about the development process of a good programme.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because in coding, the files are dependent on each other in most cases. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the commits in the repository and git diff compares two commits by providing commit IDs to observe the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can take more risks when developing.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
